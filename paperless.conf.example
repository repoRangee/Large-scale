# The passphrase you use here will be used when storing your documents in

# document exporter.  See the documentation for more information.
#
# One final note about the passphrase.  Once you've consumed a document with
# one passphrase, DON'T CHANGE IT.  Paperless assumes this to be a constant and
# can't properly export documents that were encrypted with an old passphrase if
# you've since changed it to a new one.

# After a document is consumed, Paperless can trigger an arbitrary script if
# you like.  This script will be passed a number of arguments for you to work
# with.  The default is blank, which means nothing will be executed.  For more
# information, take a look at the docs:

#PAPERLESS_POST_CONSUME_SCRIPT="/path/to/an/arbitrary/script.sh"


#
# The following values use sensible defaults for modern systems, but if you're
# running Paperless on a low-resource device (like a Raspberry Pi), modifying
# some of these values may be necessary.
#


# By default, Paperless will attempt to use all available CPU cores to process
# a document, but if you would like to limit that, you can set this value to
# an integer:
#PAPERLESS_OCR_THREADS=1


# Customize the default language that tesseract will attempt to use when
# parsing documents.  It should be a 3-letter language code consistent with ISO
# 639: https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
#PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE=eng


# On smaller systems, or even in the case of Very Large Documents, the consumer
# may explode, complaining about how it's "unable to extend pixel cache".  In
# such cases, try setting this to a reasonably low value, like 32000000.  The
# default is to use whatever is necessary to do everything without writing to
# disk, and units are in megabytes.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_MEMORY_LIMIT".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_MEMORY_LIMIT=0


# Similar to the memory limit, if you've got a small system and your OS mounts
# /tmp as tmpfs, you should set this to a path that's on a physical disk, like
# /home/your_user/tmp or something.  ImageMagick will use this as scratch space
# when crunching through very large documents.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_TMPDIR".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_TMPDIR=/var/tmp/paperless


# By default the conversion density setting for documents is 300DPI, in some
# cases it has proven useful to configure a lesser value.
# This setting has a high impact on the physical size of tmp page files,
# the speed of document conversion, and can affect the accuracy of OCR
# results. Individual results can vary and this setting should be tested
# thoroughly against the documents you are importing to see if it has any
# impacts either negative or positive.
# Testing on limited document sets has shown a setting of 200 can cut the
# size of tmp files by 1/3, and speed up conversion by up to 4x
# with little impact to OCR accuracy.
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_DENSITY=300


# The number of seconds that Paperless will wait between checking
# PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR.  If you tend to write documents to this directory
# rarely, you may want to use a higher value than the default (10).
#PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_LOOP_TIME=10
