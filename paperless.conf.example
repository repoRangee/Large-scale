# This where your documents should go to be consumed.  Make sure that it exists
# and that the user running the paperless service can read/write its contents
# before you start Paperless.
PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR=""

# These values are required if you want paperless to check a particular email
# box every 10 minutes and attempt to consume documents from there.  If you
# don't define a HOST, mail checking will just be disabled.
PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_HOST=""
PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_PORT=""
PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_USER=""
PAPERLESS_CONSUME_MAIL_PASS=""

# You must have a passphrase in order for Paperless to work at all.  If you set
# this to "", GNUGPG will "encrypt" your PDF by writing it out as a zero-byte
# file.
#
# The passphrase you use here will be used when storing your documents in
# Paperless, but you can always export them in an unencrypted format by using
# document exporter.  See the documentation for more information.
#
# One final note about the passphrase.  Once you've consumed a document with
# one passphrase, DON'T CHANGE IT.  Paperless assumes this to be a constant and
# can't properly export documents that were encrypted with an old passphrase if
# you've since changed it to a new one.
PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE="secret"

# If you intend to consume documents either via HTTP POST or by email, you must
# have a shared secret here.

# After a document is consumed, Paperless can trigger an arbitrary script if
# you like.  This script will be passed a number of arguments for you to work
# with.  The default is blank, which means nothing will be executed.  For more
# information, take a look at the docs: http://paperless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/consumption.html#hooking-into-the-consumption-process

#
# The following values use sensible defaults for modern systems, but if you're
# running Paperless on a low-resource machine (like a Raspberry Pi), modifying
# some of these values may be necessary.
#


# By default, Paperless will attempt to use all available CPU cores to process
# a document, but if you would like to limit that, you can set this value to
# an integer:
#PAPERLESS_OCR_THREADS=1

# On smaller systems, or even in the case of Very Large Documents, the consumer
# may explode, complaining about how it's "unable to extent pixel cache".  In
# such cases, try setting this to a reasonably low value, like 32000000.  The
# default is to use whatever is necessary to do everything without writing to
# disk, and units are in megabytes.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_MEMORY_LIMIT".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_MEMORY_LIMIT=0

# By default the conversion density setting for documents is 300DPI, in some
# cases it has proven useful to configure a lesser value.
# This setting has a high impact on the physical size of tmp page files,
# the speed of document conversion, and can affect the accuracy of OCR
# results. Individual results can vary and this setting should be tested
# thoroughly against the documents you are importing to see if it has any
# impacts either negative or positive. Testing on limited document sets has
# shown a setting of 200 can cut the size of tmp files by 1/3, and speed up
# conversion by up to 4x with little impact to OCR accuracy.
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_DENSITY=300

# Similar to the memory limit, if you've got a small system and your OS mounts
# /tmp as tmpfs, you should set this to a path that's on a physical disk, like
# /home/your_user/tmp or something.  ImageMagick will use this as scratch space
# when crunching through very large documents.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_TMPDIR".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_TMPDIR=/var/tmp/paperless

# You can specify where you want the SQLite database to be stored instead of
# the default location
#PAPERLESS_DBDIR=/path/to/database/file

# Override the default MEDIA_ROOT here.  This is where all files are stored.
#PAPERLESS_MEDIADIR=/path/to/media

# The number of seconds that Paperless will wait between checking
# PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR.  If you tend to write documents to this directory
# very slowly, you may want to use a higher value than the default (10).
# PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_LOOP_TIME=10

# If you're planning on putting Paperless on the open internet, then you
# really should set this value to the domain name you're using.  Failing to do
# so leaves you open to HTTP host header attacks:
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/security/#host-headers-virtual-hosting
#
# Just remember that this is a comma-separated list, so "example.com" is fine,
# as is "example.com,www.example.com", but NOT " example.com" or "example.com,"
#PAPERLESS_ALLOWED_HOSTS="example.com,www.example.com"

# Override the default UTC time zone here
#PAPERLESS_TIME_ZONE=UTC

# Customize number of list items to show per page
#PAPERLESS_LIST_PER_PAGE=50

# Customize the default language that tesseract will attempt to use when parsing
# documents.  It should be a 3-letter language code consistent with ISO 639.
#PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE=eng

# The number of items on each page in the web UI.  This value must be a
# positive integer, but if you don't define one in paperless.conf, a default of
# 100 will be used.
#PAPERLESS_LIST_PER_PAGE=100

# The secret key has a default that should be fine so long as you're hosting
# Paperless on a closed network.  However, if you're putting this anywhere
# public, you should change the key to something unique and verbose.
#PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY="change-me"
