# This where your documents should go to be consumed.  Make sure that it exists
# and that the user running the paperless service can read/write its contents
# before you start Paperless.
PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR=""

# These values are required if you want paperless to check a particular email
# box every 10 minutes and attempt to consume documents from there.  If you
# don't define a HOST, mail checking will just be disabled.

# You must have a passphrase in order for Paperless to work at all.  If you set
# this to "", GNUGPG will "encrypt" your PDF by writing it out as a zero-byte
# file.
#
# The passphrase you use here will be used when storing your documents in
# Paperless, but you can always export them in an unencrypted format by using
# document exporter.  See the documentation for more information.
#
# One final note about the passphrase.  Once you've consumed a document with
# one passphrase, DON'T CHANGE IT.  Paperless assumes this to be a constant and
# can't properly export documents that were encrypted with an old passphrase if
# you've since changed it to a new one.
PAPERLESS_PASSPHRASE="secret"

# If you intend to consume documents either via HTTP POST or by email, you must
# have a shared secret here.
PAPERLESS_SHARED_SECRET=""

# By default, Paperless will attempt to use all available CPU cores to process
# a document, but if you would like to limit that, you can set this value to
# an integer:
#PAPERLESS_OCR_THREADS=1
