Paperless
=========

Scan, index, and archive all of your paper documents.  Say goodbye to paper.

Why This Exists
===============

Paper is a nightmare.  Environmental issues aside, there's no excuse for it in
the 21st century.  It takes up space, collects dust, doesn't support any form of
a search feature, indexing is tedious, it's heavy and prone to damage & loss.

I wrote this to make "going paperless" easier.  I wanted to be able to feed
documents right from the post box into the scanner and then shred them so I
never have to worry about finding stuff again.  Perhaps you might find it useful
too.
